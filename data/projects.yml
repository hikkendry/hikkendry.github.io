  intro: "Website and intuitive CMS for the annual songwriting competition hosted by the worlds leading microphone manufacturer."
  content:
    p1: "Let’s face it, making it big in the music industry is not easy. Every year, Shure (the leading manufacturer of microphones and headphones) and The ICMP (Europe’s leading independent school of modern music) host a songwriting competition for unsigned artists with great prizes that give entrants a foot in the music-biz door."
    p2: "They approached us with an outdated flash site that desperately needed bringing up to date and integrating with their social platforms to increase reach and accessibility. Since taking on the project 2 years ago we’ve worked strategically to see entries increase and their Facebook audience more than quadruple."

  intro: "Full website and strategy overhaul with the leading UK source on underground electronic music."
  content:
    p1: "Hyponik is run by passionate and enthusiastic promoters and artists with ambitions to be the UK’s finest source for underground electronic music. They came to us in need of a better way to showcase their great creative content as their site looked dated and wasn’t performing to its full potential."
    p2: "We overhauled their existing CMS to streamline their editorial process and applied a clean design to the front-end that works on any screen size, putting the focus on the content. By making the design modular we’re able to easily swap or move elements for usability and A/B testing, optimising page content and layouts, and testing new features. This is all part of our long-term work with Hyponik to ensure the projects ongoing success."

  intro: "Website and branding for these talented builders of handcrafted retail environments."
  content:
    p1: "If you’re a bunch of talented creative retail designers you’re going to need a stand out identity and unique website. That’s why Lucky Fox came to us. After years building dazzling bespoke window installations and interiors for Levis, Harvey Nichols and Converse (to name but a few) Jason Traves decided to form his own retail design outfit and Lucky Fox was born."
    p2: "As a man of impeccable taste with a keen eye for design we knew his branding and website needed to be clean and iconic. We delivered a carefully considered branding package and style guide that they’ve been able to apply in a range of creative ways from a customised ice-cream van to laser etched wood and even sticks of brighton rock!"
