    p1: "A responsive website working on desktop, tablet and mobile devices; the site uses an animated background triggered on scroll as a metephor for the diminishing availablility of the wireless spectrum."

  content:
    p1: "Founded in 2004 Concrete Hermit have existed somewhere between a gallery, shop, publisher, t-shirt label across a variety of projects and in various guises. When they slimmed down their e-commerce catalog they approached us to give them a minimal front end design with powerful shopping cart features that work across desktop, tablet and moblie devices. "
    p2: "E-commerce solutions can be resource intensive which can lead to them being slow and expensive. We set up resource and traffic monitoring and spent some time tuning our development environment to exactly match the hosting on the server so that we could offer speed enhancements while keeping the resource overhead and costs to a minimum. This means we can quickly and confidently develop and deploy new features and enhancements for the site."

    p1: "Hyponik is run by passionate and enthusiastic promoters and artists with ambitions to be the UK’s finest source for underground electronic music.

    p2: "We overhauled their existing CMS to streamline their editorial process and applied a clean design to the front-end that works on any screen size, putting the focus on the content. By making the design modular we’re able to easily swap or move elements for usability and A/B testing, optimising page content and layouts, and testing new features. This is all part of our long-term work with Hyponik to ensure the projects ongoing success."
